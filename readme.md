## Background
gamba was created by [Oliver J. Scholten](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=tvAteogAAAAJ&hl=en) as a way to transparently replicate existing work in the field of player behaviour tracking. By open sourcing the tools needed to perform existing analyses, we hope to help researchers and regulators keep pace with understanding new gambling technologies and their social and economic impacts.
