Getting Started
--------------------
*gamba* aims to provide powerful analytical code which is easy to use, and easy to extend. To meet this goal, the :doc:`user guide <user_guide/index>` will take you through your first analysis using the *gamba* library, and the :doc:`API reference <api/index>` contains full documentation for each method so you can add to the code from the guide. 
The replications section is also a great place to start if you're looking to use the methodology from an existing study on a new data set, and would like something out-of-the-box.
