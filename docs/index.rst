*gamba* provides open source implementations of existing analytical methods and data cleaning procedures. This makes replicating research easy, and exploring new methods and data sets possible. You can use the library to create a full analytical process - from data to publication - or use methods you need in your own code to create something new.

The best way to get started using *gamba* is to read through the links below, and read through some of the :doc:`study replications <research/replications/index>` which are now possible using :doc:`gamba's functions <user_guide/index>`.
