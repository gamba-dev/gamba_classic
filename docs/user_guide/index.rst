User Guide
==============


Welcome to the gamba user guide!

The next few pages will take you through using functions from different parts of the gamba library to perform a range of data loading, measure calculating, player labelling, and visualising tasks (and more).
The user guide is geared towards helping new users get started, and as a friendly reference point on how to use some of the functions.
If you're looking for the no-frills documentation, it's available here: :doc:`../api/index`.

The first task in any data analysis is to load in some data.
To get started, click the link below, or one of the other topics if you've got a specific task in mind;
