User Guide
==============


Welcome to the gamba user guide! The next few pages will take you through using functions from different parts of the gamba library to perform a range of data loading, measure calculating, player labelling, and visualisation tasks (and more).
The user guide is geared towards helping new users get started, and as a friendly reference point on how to use some of the functions.
If you're looking for the no-frills documentation, head over to the :doc:`../api/index`.

	<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Before we begin, make sure you have gamba installed on your system (see the :doc:`../installation` page). Access to a transaction data set is not necessary because gamba can generate data for testing purposes. That said, it wouldn't be much of a user guide if it didn't start with how to load in your own data. Go through the links below in order to see how gamba's methods can be used to create a full analytical pipeline;
