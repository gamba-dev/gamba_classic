Installation
==================


Install as a Researcher
----------------------------------

To install gamba, use the following pip command;

.. code-block:: none

	pip install gamba

Although not required, `Jupyter Lab <https://jupyter.org>`_ may be useful for interactive use, and for working through the :any:`replications<research/replications/index>`.


.. _dev install:

Install as a Developer
-----------------------

To get started on developing gamba, execute the below command which will clone the github repository to your computer. If you're new to git, github, or open source in general, `this video series <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjQznt-8kE&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9goXbgTDQ0n_4TBzOO0ocPR>`_ or the `github help pages <https://help.github.com/en/github>`_ are really useful.

.. code-block:: none

	git clone https://github.com/gamba-dev/gamba.git

With the repository cloned, you're ready to start exploring. We recommend opening the gamba folder in the `Sublime Text <https://www.sublimetext.com/>`_ editor. The package can be installed using the following command from inside the gamba directory;

.. code-block:: none

	pip install --upgrade ../gamba/

This will install the package from the local folder (not the PyPi version), reinstalling the package even if it appears up to date.
