## Documentation Images

This folder contains each of the diagrams used in the documentation.

It includes both SVG and PDF versions of each image, the SVG versions are used in the `make html` command to build the HTML documentaiton, and the PDF versions are used in the `make latexpdf` PDF documentation.

See the [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OKeKKDtTdrBmpr7LBf4_hCP2x-Wz-8v/view?usp=sharing) and open it through [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) if you'd like to add or change images!
