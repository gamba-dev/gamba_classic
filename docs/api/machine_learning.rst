gamba.machine_learning
======================

The gamba.machine_learning module contains methods for applying machine learning methods like clustering algorithms, random forests, and neural networks, to behavioural measures. This includes wrappers for methods found in the scikit-learn, statsmodels, and statistics modules.

.. note::
	Studies which use stochastic analytical methods, such as some of those in this module, are unlikely to be able to produce *exact* replications, especially on small samples.
