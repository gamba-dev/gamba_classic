We hope other researchers use the functions gamba provides to perform studies on new data, or improve the functions to create new analyses on existing data.
This page presents any studies which have used gamba in part of their analyses.
If you have used gamba, and would like your paper added to this page, please `email us here <mailto:oliver@gamba.dev>`_.
