This study applies a collection of supervised machine learning techniques to analytical data created during Braverman and Shaffer's 2010 study on high-risk gamblers.
These include logistic regressions, neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests.
The learning module in the gamba library contains methods for performing these techniques, where each accept a measures table as a parameter like other analytical methods in the library.
To get started, import gamba as follows;
