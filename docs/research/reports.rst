Verified Reports
====================


.. note:: This is an upcoming feature

One of the gamba library's strengths is its transparency, which means users can trust that the outputs are true to the data you supply.
To make the most of this strength, gamba can be used to create a **verified report**, which is a fixed analysis of a data set using methods from the gamba library.

A verified report contains everything from basic information about the number and growth of players in the data set, to some behavioural measures and analytical methods from the more advanced parts of the library.
These reports are useful for getting quick insights into your data, and to promote openness and transparency both inside and outside your organisation.


To create a gamba verified report, run the following two lines of code, replacing the CSV file name with your own transaction data.

.. ipython:: python

	import gamba as gb

	# gb.verified_report('your_transaction_data.csv')

This page will be completed once the feature is fully implemented.
